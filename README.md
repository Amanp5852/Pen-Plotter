**CoreXY ESP32 Pen Plotter**
This project is a fully functional CoreXY-based pen plotter designed for precision, speed, and ease of use. It brings together mechanical engineering, electronics, control systems, and intuitive software to deliver a reliable plotting experience.

Mechanical & Hardware Features
CoreXY motion system for high-speed, precise X/Y movement with reduced inertia.

GT2 timing belts and precision drivers for smooth, consistent motion.

Custom 3D-printed components for the frame, carriage, belt tensioners, and pen holder.

Servo-driven Z-axis for controlled pen up/down motion.

Limit switches for repeatable homing and reference positioning.

Emergency stop to instantly halt motion and return safely to the home position.

Electronics & Control
Powered by an ESP32 microcontroller for fast processing and wireless capability.

PID-based closed-loop control with real-time feedback from optical encoders.

Encoder feedback ensures accurate path following, even during complex or long plots.

Software & User Interface
Custom firmware built from the ground up for CoreXY kinematics and closed-loop PID control.

User-friendly UI for easy operation — allowing you to control movements, start/stop plotting, trigger homing, and manage the emergency stop with minimal learning curve.

UI designed for accessibility, making it easy for beginners and efficient for advanced users.

Safety & Reliability
Integrated emergency stop ensures quick reaction to errors or obstructions.

Homing process guarantees consistent starting points for all drawings.

Sturdy yet lightweight structure ensures durability without sacrificing portability.

This pen plotter is not just a demonstration of precise motion control — it’s a complete system that merges mechanical design, control theory, and user-centric software into a versatile plotting tool. Whether for art, technical drawings, or experimental automation, it delivers consistent and repeatable results while keeping operation intuitive and safe.plotted artwork or technical drawings.
